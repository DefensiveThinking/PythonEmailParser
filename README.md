# Python Directory Email Parser
This Python Script is used to parse email addresses out of .txt, .csv, .sql and .xlsx files. 

To run the script you must have Python installed on your Mac, Windows or Linux machines. 

This will search root directory and all subfolders for these file types. No need to manually run the process on each individual file type.
